# APCSA-Review-Student-Code-Project
This project was done in the first semester of my AP CSA class.

**What this is: **
This repository contrains a Java program I worked on in my first semester of my APCSA class.
The base code was provided, and I implemented additional methods and logic.

**What I worked on**
•I added the totalSentiment method
•I added the starRating method
•I added the fakeReview method
•I added the turnReviewNeg method
•I added the search method

**What I learned**
This project taught me:
•File input
•String parsing 
•Debugging 
•Understanding existing codebases

**Why it's here**
I'm using GitHub to track my growth as a programmer, including my early and imperfect work.
